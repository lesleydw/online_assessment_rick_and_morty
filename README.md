# Online_assessment_rick_and_morty

This project showcases characters from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty" using the Rick and Morty API. The user can navigate through different pages to view different characters and see details such as their names and images.

## Features
- **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**: The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors. Depending on the viewport width, the character grid adjusts its layout to display in one, two, or three columns.

- **Pagination Logic**: The application uses pagination to provide an organized viewing experience. Users can navigate between pages of character results to explore the vast array of characters available in the API. Each page showcases a set number of characters, and intuitive navigation controls allow for seamless movement between pages.
